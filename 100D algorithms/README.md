### 100 days of algorithms

This repository contains notebooks with live code to accompany [100 days of algorithms](https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms) challenge.

I set the challenge for myself to implement algorithm by algorithm, day by day, until the number reaches **100**.

If you are interested, here's the [intro to the series](https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms/100-days-of-algorithms-challenge-41996f7e1ec8) and [all the articles](https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms/latest) sorted by date from the latest.

The challenge was quite fun and rough, as well. Do not expect the implementations to be the best, nor fastest, nor nicest, nor bug-free. Do expect to see code written in haste. A code that contains the same amount of enthusiasm and love to algorithms as many it contains bugs.

Feel free to (re)use my code in any way you wish, but bare in mind that the source code is provided "as-is". It is on your own risk and you are solely responsible for whatever happens then.

#### local machine

* download and install the latest version of [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution
* clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/coells/100days.git`
* open terminal and run Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook`
* open [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/tree) in your browser

#### notes

* the codebase was developed using `Python 3.6` and `Anaconda 4.3.1`
* notebooks containing [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) plots are not directly supported by Github; you better clone the repo a run notebooks locally

#### alternate repository

[Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/coells/libraries/100days) with `Python 3.5` support
