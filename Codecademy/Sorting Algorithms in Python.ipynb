    "#### Bubble Sort Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bubble sort is an introductory sorting algorithm that iterates through a list and compares pairings of adjacent elements.**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the sorting criteria, the algorithm swaps elements to shift elements towards the beginning or end of the list.By default, a list is sorted if for any element e and position 1 through N: e1 <= e2 <= e3 … eN, where N is the number of elements in the list. For example, bubble sort transforms a list: `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5]` to an ascending order, from lowest to highest: `[1, 2, 5, 5, 9]`\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement the algorithm with two loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first loop iterates as long as the list is unsorted and we assume it’s unsorted to start.Within this loop, another iteration moves through the list. For each pairing, the algorithm asks: In comparison, is the first element larger than the second element? If it is, we swap the position of the elements. The larger element is now at a greater index than the smaller element. When a swap is made, we know the list is still unsorted. The outer loop will run again when the inner loop concludes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process repeats until the largest element makes its way to the last index of the list. The outer loop runs until no swaps are made within the inner loop.\n",

    "冒泡排序（Bubble Sort）也是一种简单直观的排序算法。它重复地走访过要排序的数列，一次比较两个元素，如果他们的顺序错误就把他们交换过来。走访数列的工作是重复地进行直到没有再需要交换，也就是说该数列已经排序完成。这个算法的名字由来是因为越小的元素会经由交换慢慢\"浮\"到数列的顶端。\n",
    "\n",
    "![](bubbleSort.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bubble Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, the bubble sort algorithm swaps elements if the element on the left is larger than the one on the right. How does this algorithm swap these elements in practice?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we have the two values stored at the following indices index_1 and index_2. How would we swap these two elements within the list?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is tempting to write code like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "list[index_1] = list[index_2]\n",
    "list[index_2] = list[index_1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we do this, we lose the original value at index_1. The element gets replaced by the value at index_2. Both indices end up with the value at index_2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages have different ways of avoiding this issue. In some languages, we create a temporary variable which holds one element during the swap:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "temp = list[index_1]\n",
    "list[index_1] = list[index_2]\n",
    "list[index_2] = temp \n",

    "\n",
    "Given a moderately unsorted data-set, bubble sort requires multiple passes through the input before producing a sorted list. Each pass through the list will place the next largest value in its proper place.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are performing n-1 comparisons for our inner loop. Then, we must go through the list n times in order to ensure that each item in our list has been placed in its proper order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The n signifies the number of elements in the list. In a worst case scenario, the inner loop does n-1 comparisons for each n element in the list.\n",
    "\n",

    "![](Codecademy_runtime.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating the run-time efficiency of an algorithm, we drop the constant (-1), which simplifies our inner loop comparisons to n.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we arrive at the algorithm’s runtime: O(n^2).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bubble Sort Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble sort is an algorithm to sort a list through repeated swaps of adjacent elements. It has a runtime of O(n^2).\n",
    "\n",
    "For nearly sorted lists, bubble sort performs relatively few operations since it only performs a swap when elements are out of order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble sort is a good introductory algorithm which opens the door to learning more complex algorithms. It answers the question, “How can we algorithmically sort a list?” and encourages us to ask, “How can we improve this sorting algorithm?”\n",

    "### BUBBLE SORT: PYTHON\n",
    "#### Bubble Sort: Swap\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bubble Sort algorithm works by comparing a pair of neighbor elements and shifting the larger of the two to the right. Bubble Sort completes this by swapping the two elements’ positions if the first element being compared is larger than the second element being compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a quick pseudocode example of what we will create:\n",
    "```\n",
    "for each pair(elem1, elem2):\n",
    "  if elem1 > elem2:\n",
    "    swap(elem1, elem2)\n",
    "  else:\n",
    "    # analyze next set of pairs\n",
    "```\n",
    "This swap() sub-routine is an essential part of the algorithm. Bubble sort swaps elements repeatedly until the largest element in the list is placed at the greatest index. This looping continues until the list is sorted.\n",

    "### MERGE SORT: CONCEPTUAL\n",
    "#### What Is A Merge Sort?\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort is a sorting algorithm created by John von Neumann in 1945. Merge sort’s “killer app” was the strategy that breaks the list-to-be-sorted into smaller parts, sometimes called a divide-and-conquer algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a divide-and-conquer algorithm, the data is continually broken down into smaller elements until sorting them becomes really simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort was the first of many sorts that use this strategy, and is still in use today in many different applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Codecademy_mergesort.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "####  How To Merge Sort:\n",
    "Merge sorting takes two steps: splitting the data into “runs” or smaller components, and the re-combining those runs into sorted lists (the “merge”).\n",
    "\n",
    "When splitting the data, we divide the input to our sort in half. We then recursively call the sort on each of those halves, which cuts the halves into quarters. This process continues until all of the lists contain only a single element. Then we begin merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "When merging two single-element lists, we check if the first element is smaller or larger than the other. Then we return the two-element list with the smaller element followed by the larger element.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Codecademy_divide.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Merging\n",
    "\n",
    "When merging larger pre-sorted lists we build the list similarly to how we did with single-element lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s call the two lists left and right. Bothleft and right are already sorted. We want to combine them (to merge them) into a larger sorted list, let’s call it both. To accomplish this we’ll need to iterate through both with two indices, left_index and right_index.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first left_index and right_index both point to the start of their respective lists. left_index points to the smallest element of left (its first element) and right_index points to the smallest element of right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the elements at left_index and right_index. The smaller of these two elements should be the first element of both because it’s the smallest of both! It’s the smallest of the two smallest values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say that smallest value was in left. We continue by incrementing left_index to point to the next-smallest value in left. Then we compare the 2nd smallest value in left against the smallest value of right. Whichever is smaller of these two is now the 2nd smallest value of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of “look at the two next-smallest elements of each list and add the smaller one to our resulting list” continues on for as long as both lists have elements to compare. Once one list is exhausted, say every element from left has been added to the result, then we know that all the elements of the other list, right, should go at the end of the resulting list (they’re larger than every element we’ve added so far).\n",

    "\n",
    "Merge sort was unique for its time in that the best, worst, and average time complexity are all the same: Θ(N*log(N)). This means an almost-sorted list will take the same amount of time as a completely out-of-order list. This is acceptable because the worst-case scenario, where a sort could stand to take the most time, is as fast as a sorting algorithm can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some sorts attempt to improve upon the merge sort by first inspecting the input and looking for “runs” that are already pre-sorted. Timsort is one such algorithm that attempts to use pre-sorted data in a list to the sorting algorithm’s advantage. If the data is already sorted, Timsort runs in Θ(N) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort also requires space. Each separation requires a temporary array, and so a merge sort would require enough space to save the whole of the input a second time. This means the worst-case space complexity of merge sort is O(N).\n",

    "### QUICKSORT: CONCEPTUAL\n",
    "\n",
    "Quicksort is an efficient recursive algorithm for sorting arrays or lists of values. The algorithm is a comparison sort, where values are ordered by a comparison operation such as > or <.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quicksort uses a divide and conquer strategy, breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems until the solution is so clear there’s nothing to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem: many values in the array which are out of order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution: break the array into sub-arrays containing at most one element. One element is sorted by default!\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose a single pivot element from the list. Every other element is compared with the pivot, which partitions the array into three groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A sub-array of elements smaller than the pivot.\n",
    "3. The pivot itself.\n",
    "4. A sub-array of elements greater than the pivot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is repeated on the sub-arrays until they contain zero or one element. Elements in the “smaller than” group are never compared with elements in the “greater than” group. If the smaller and greater groupings are roughly equal, this cuts the problem in half with each partition step!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[6,5,2,1,9,3,8,7]\n",
    "6 # The pivot\n",
    "[5, 2, 1, 3] # lesser than 6\n",
    "[9, 8, 7] # greater than 6\n",

    "\n",
    "[5,2,1,3]  # these values\n",
    "# will never be compared with \n",
    "[9,8,7] # these values\n",
    "```\n",
    "Depending on the implementation, the sub-arrays of one element each are recombined into a new array with sorted ordering, or values within the original array are swapped in-place, producing a sorted mutation of the original array.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quicksort Runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to Quicksort’s runtime efficiency is the division of the array. The array is partitioned according to comparisons with the pivot element, so which pivot is the optimal choice to produce sub-arrays of roughly equal length?\n",
    "\n",
    "The graphic displays two data sets which always use the first element as the pivot. Notice how many more steps are required when the quicksort algorithm is run on an already sorted input. The partition step of the algorithm hardly divides the array at all!\n",
    "\n",
    "The worst case occurs when we have an imbalanced partition like when the first element is continually chosen in a sorted data-set.\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular strategy is to select a random element as the pivot for each step. The benefit is that no particular data set can be chosen ahead of time to make the algorithm perform poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular strategy is to take the first, middle, and last elements of the array and choose the median element as the pivot. The benefit is that the division of the array tends to be more uniform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quicksort is an unusual algorithm in that the worst case runtime is O(N^2), but the average case is O(N * logN).\n",
    "\n",
    "We typically only discuss the worst case when talking about an algorithm’s runtime, but for Quicksort it’s so uncommon that we generally refer to it as O(N * logN).\n",

    "\n",
    "Quicksort is an efficient algorithm for sorting values in a list. A single element, the pivot, is chosen from the list. All the remaining values are partitioned into two sub-lists containing the values smaller than and greater than the pivot element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, this process of dividing the array will produce sub-lists of nearly equal length, otherwise, the runtime of the algorithm suffers.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the dividing step returns sub-lists that have one or less elements, each sub-list is sorted. The sub-lists are recombined, or swaps are made in the original array, to produce a sorted list of values.\n",

    "## RADIX SORT\n",
    "### RADIX SORT: CONCEPTUAL\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Is A Radix\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick, which number is bigger: 1489012 or 54? It’s 1489012, but how can you tell? It has more digits so it has to be larger, but why exactly is that the case?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our number system was developed by 8th century Arabic mathematicians and was successful because it made arithmetic operations more sensible and larger numbers easier to write and comprehend.\n",
    "\n",
    "The breakthrough those mathematicians made required defining a set of rules for how to depict every number. First we decide on an alphabet: different glyphs, or digits, that we’ll use to write our numbers with. The alphabet that we use to depict numbers in this system are the ten digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. We call the length of this alphabet our radix (or base). So for our decimal system, we have a radix of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to understand what those digits mean in different positions. In our system we have a ones place, a tens place, a hundreds place and so on. So what do digits mean in each of those places?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where explaining gets a little complicated because the actual knowledge might feel very fundamental. There’s a difference, for instance, between the digit ‘6’ and the actual number six that we represent with the digit ‘6’. This difference is similar to the difference between the letter ‘a’ (which we can use in lots of words) and the word ‘a’.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Codecademy_radixalphabet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "But the core of the idea is that we use these digits to represent different values when they’re used in different positions. The digit 6 in the number 26 represents the value 6, but the digit 6 used in the number 86452 represents the value 6000.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Base Numbering Systems\n",
    "The value of different positions in a number increases by a multiplier of 10 in increasing positions. This means that a digit ‘8’ in the rightmost place of a number is equal to the value 8, but that same digit when shifted left one position (i.e., in 80) is equal to 10 * 8. If you shift it again one position you get 800, which is 10 * 10 * 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where it’s useful to incorporate the shorthand of exponential notation. It’s important to note that 100 is equal to 1. Each position corresponds to a different exponent of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Codecademy_base.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So why 10? It’s a consequence of how many digits are in our alphabet for numbering. Since we have 10 digits (0-9) we can count all the way up to 9 before we need to use a different position. This system that we used is called base-10 because of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sorting By Radix\n",
    "So how does a radix sort use this base numbering system to sort integers? First, there are two different kinds of radix sort: most significant digit, or MSD, and least significant digit, or LSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both radix sorts organize the input list into ten “buckets”, one for each digit. The numbers are placed into the buckets based on the MSD (left-most digit) or LSD (right-most digit). For example, the number 2367 would be placed into the bucket “2” for MSD and into “7” for LSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Codecademy_radix.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This bucketing process is repeated over and over again until all digits in the longest number have been considered. The order within buckets for each iteration is preserved. For example, the numbers 23, 25 and 126 are placed in the “3”, “5”, and “6” buckets for an initial LSD bucketing. On the second iteration of the algorithm, they are all placed into the “2” bucket, but the order is preserved as 23, 25, 126.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Radix Sort Performance\n",
    "The most amazing feature of radix sort is that it manages to sort a list of integers without performing any comparisons whatsoever. We call this a non-comparison sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes its performance a little difficult to compare to most other comparison-based sorts. Consider a list of length n. For each iteration of the algorithm, we are deciding which bucket to place each of the n entries into.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many iterations do we have? Remember that we continue iterating until we examine each digit. This means we need to iterate for how ever many digits we have. We’ll call this average number of digits the word-size or w.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Codecademy_radixruntime.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the complexity of radix sort is O(wn). Assuming the length of the list is much larger than the number of digits, we can consider w a constant factor and this can be reduced to O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Radix Review\n",
    "Take a moment to review radix sort:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A radix is the base of a number system. For the decimal number system, the radix is 10.\n",
    "- Radix sort has two variants - MSD and LSD\n",
    "- Numbers are bucketed based on the value of digits moving left to right (for MSD) or right to left (for LSD)\n",
    "- Radix sort is considered a non-comparison sort\n",
    "- The performance of radix sort is O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "### RADIX SORT: PYTHON\n",
    "#### Finding the Max Exponent\n",
    "In our version of least significant digit radix sort, we’re going to utilize the string representation of each integer. This, combined with negative indexing, will allow us to count each digit in a number from right-to-left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other implementations utilize integer division and modular arithmetic to find each digit in a radix sort, but our goal here is to build an intuition for how the sort works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step is going to be finding the max_exponent, which is the number of digits long the largest number is. We’re going to find the largest number, cast it to a string, and take the length of that string.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define your function radix_sort() that takes a list as input and call that input to_be_sorted.\n",
    "- In order to determine how many digits are in the longest number in the list, we’ll need to find the longest number.Declare a new variable maximum_value and assign the max() of to_be_sorted to it.\n",
    "- Now we want to define our max_exponent.\n",
    "    - First, cast maximum_value to a string.\n",
    "    - Then take the len() of that string.\n",
    "    - Then assign that len() to a variable called max_exponent.\n",
    "    - Then return max_exponent."

It would be bad practice to mutate the input list — in case something goes wrong with our code, or someone using our sort decides they don’t want to wait anymore. We wouldn’t want anyone out there to have to deal with the surprise of having their precious list of integers mangled. Create a copy of to_be_sorted and save the copy into a new list called being_sorted.\n",
    "- A radix sort goes through each position of each number and puts all of the inputs in different buckets depending on the value . Since there are 10 different values (that is, 0 through 9) that a position can have, we need to create ten different buckets to put each number in. Create a list of ten empty lists and assign the result to a variable called digits. Then return digits."

    "You recently began employment at “A Sorted Tale”, an independent bookshop. Every morning, the owner decides to sort the books in a new way.\n",

    "\n",
    "- By author name\n",
    "- By title\n",
    "- By number of characters in the title\n",
    "- By the reverse of the author’s name\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the day, patrons of the bookshop remove books from the shelf. Given the strange ordering of the store, they do not always get the books placed back in exactly the correct location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The owner wants you to research methods of fixing the book ordering throughout the day and sorting the books in the morning. It is currently taking too long!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get to know the data\n",
    "    - The owner provides the current state of the bookshelf in a comma-separated values, or csv, file. To get you started, we have provided a function load_books, defined in utils.py. bWithin script.py, we are loading the books from books_small.csv. This list of 10 books makes it easier to determine how the algorithms are behaving. we’ll use this to develop the algorithms and then we’ll try them out later on the larger file. Add a for loop to print the titles within the bookshelf. Save your code and run it using python3 script.py in the terminal.\n",
    "    - Today’s sorting is by title and looking at the bookshelf it’s pretty close. Some patrons have placed books back in slightly the wrong place. Before we start solving the problem, we need to do a bit of data manipulation to ensure that we compare books correctly. Python’s built-in comparison operators compare letters lexicographically based on their Unicode code point. You can determine the code point of characters using Python’s built-in ord function. For example to calculate the code point for “z” you would use the following code: `ord(\"z\")` Try this in script.py using print statements:\n",
    "        - What is the code point of “a”?\n",
    "        - What about “ “?\n",
    "        - What about “A”?\n",
    "    - You may have noticed that the uppercase letters have values less than their lowercase counterparts. When sorting, we don’t want to take into account the case of the letters. For example, “cats” should come before “Dogs”, even though ord(\"c\") > ord(\"D\") is True. We’ll make this happen by converting everything to lowercase prior to comparison. Since we need to do this often, lets save the lowercase author and title as attributes while loading the bookshelf in utils.py:\n",

    "    - As we noted, our books are pretty close to being sorted by title. From the sorting lessons, you may remember that bubble sort performs well for nearly sorted data such as this. The code for performing bubble sort on an array of numbers is provided in sorts.py. However, we are sorting on books which are Python dictionaries. Further, the owner likes to change the ordering of books daily. To make the sort order flexible, add an argument comparison_function. This will allow us to pass in a custom function for comparing the order of two books.\n",
    "    - Our comparison_function will take two arguments, and return True if the first one is “greater than” the second. Within the body of the bubble sort function, modify the comparison conditional statement to use the comparison_function instead of the built in operators (if arr[idx] > arr[idx + 1]:).\n",
    "    - Now that we have a bubble sort algorithm that can work on books, let’s give it a shot. Within script.py define a sort comparison function, by_title_ascending. It should take book_a and book_b as arguments. It should return True if the title_lower of book_a is “greater than” the title_lower of book_b and False otherwise.\n",
    "    - Sort the bookshelf using bubble sort. Save the result as sort_1 and print the titles to the console to verify the order. How many swaps were necessary?"
