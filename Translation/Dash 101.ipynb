    "### 1 Why do we need digital cash!\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series, you will learn everything you need to know about digital cash, especially about its most advanced form which is called Dash.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, you may wonder why do we need digital cash at all, we already have dollars, euros, bank accounts, credit cards, and all that works pretty well. Doesn't it? Well, not really. If you have a closer look at our monetary system, you will see that it's full of flaws. In the current system, the state has a monopoly on money. And monopolies are always bad for everyone except the monopolist. The Institution called the central bank can issue new money at will, as coins and banknotes, but today most of it is in digital form. The state also gives the normal banks the right to issue new money. When a bank gives a loan to someone who wants to buy a house, the bank can create this money at the push of a button, but the borrower still has to pay interest on it and if he cannot pay back his loan, the bank will get his house. Although it has created the money for it out of nothing, does this sound like a fair system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I don’t think so, another problem is when the amount of money increases, but the  amount of goods and services you can buy for it stays the same, prices will inevitably go up, that's an economic law, that has no exceptions. If the central bank issues more and more money, everybody's money lose its value. This so called inflation eats up the salaries and savings of normal citizens. In some country, inflation is so high that prices go up every day and you need stacks of banknotes to just buy small things. But even if the inflation is less extreme, it means every year you can buy less for your money. Abundant money often goes into the safe heavy of real estate, and drives housing prices up so much that normal people can hardly make ends meet. In a centralized monetary system, the ones who are close to the source of the newly created money benefit at the expense of everybody else. Government officials, bankers, and other powerful people get new money first before prices go up. But workers, employees, pensioners and all those people who are not close to the central source of money receive it only once prices have already risen. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is unfair redistribution of wealth from the average people to the ones in power. This monopoly on money is the main cause of many economic crises. Many people have lost their hard-earned savings due to hyperinflation, currency devaluations, frozen bank accounts and all those nasty things that happen when a central power can manipulate the money supply. We have learned from socialists experiments all over the world that  central planning of the economy never works. Open competition and  a free market always leads to better results. This isn't any different when it comes to money. Isn't it strange that despite the obvious advantages the free market system that money, the lifeblood of the economy, is still controlled by a central institution. Since the gold backing of money was completely abolished in 1970s, governments have piled up more and more debt, sooner or later, a system that is based on ever-growing debt will collapse like a house of cards. Digital cash aims to end this state monopoly on money with all its flaws. It is a decentralized system that allows direct payments from human to human without any middlemen. The inventors of the digital cash want to build a system in which you don't have to trust anyone, no bank, no government no one could abuse your trust. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to have a free competition of currencies. Most digital cash systems have a defined maximum amount of coins that  can ever exists. The amount of newly generated digital coins diminishes over time. So they are as scarce as gold by design. But how you may ask, does such a free market based digital cash system work, we will explain this in the nest episodes!\n",

    "### 2 What Are Public And Private Keys?\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first episode, we explained why we need a better monetary system which works without a central institution. Now, let's discuss how decentralized money works. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that needs to be clear when we talk about money is who owns it. With physical cash, it's easy. If I hold this banknote in my hand, it’s obvious that's mine. If I give it to you, it's yours. With digital cash, it's a bit more tricky, because you can't touch it. So you need a digital key to prove that you are the owner of the digital coin. And if you want to send it to someone else, you need digitally signed the transaction with this key. Digital cash works with cryptography which is a special form of mathematics. It's all about scrambling and unscrambling data. You don't have to become an expert in this filed, all you need to understand is the concepts of public and private key. They always come in pairs. For each public key, there is a unique private key. Both are strange combinations of letters and numbers, but don't worry you don't need to learn them by heart. There is a special kind of software called wallet, which will handle the keys for you. The public key or more precisely the address that is generated by it can be compared to number of a bank account. If you want to send some money to a friend, you need to know his bank account number or in our case, his public address. Unlike a bank account number, everyone can have unlimited number of this addresses, but all you can do with the public part of the key pair is to send money to it, nothing else. If you want to spend that money, you need the other half of the pair, the private key. This can be compared to the pin code of your bank account. You need it to access your money, so you really should  keep it secret and never share with anyone else. If you want to send money to someone, you need to sign the transaction with your private key. The key itself never leaves your computer or cell phone, it's needed to digitally sign a transaction and the signature proves you are the legitimate owner of the money you are sending. The math behind this is rather complicated  but making the transaction really simple.  You fill in the public address of the receiver in one field, the amount that you want to send in another, and click SEND. The rest is being handled in the background by your wallet software.  Surely afterwards, your friend will see in his wallet that the money is on its way, and after the transaction has been confirmed by the digital cash network, he can expend it. We will explain this in our next episode how this confirmation process works.\n",

    "### 3 What Is a Blockchain ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last episode, you learned that you need a public and a private key to make digital cash work. Cryptography is used  to prove the ownership of a digital asset, but there is another challenge, in the digital realm, a copy is as good as the original, this is great for music or video files, but for money it's a problem. Imagine if I have one digital coin, and I send it to my friend Alice, but hey, it's digital so I can make a copy of it, and  also send it to Bob, and to Charlie, and to Doris, and to Eric and Flora. I would be a rich girl,  I could just copy my digital coin endlessly. Well, no, money doesn't work like this. Remember what we said about the monetary system in the first episode. If the money supply grows and grows, but the amount of goods and services you can buy with it stays the same, the prices will and must go up. We would have hyperinflation like Germany in 1920s, or in today's Venezuela. So if we could easily copy the digital cash, it would be as worthless as the rice mark or the Bolivar. Good money has be scarce, as scarce as gold or silver. The question is how can you prevent me from just copying my digital coin endlessly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, there needs to be some kind of register where everyone could look up that I own this digital coin. And once  I send it to Alice, everyone should know that I don't have it any more. But if this register was on some central server, we would have to trust the ones who run it. And remember we want a system without a central institution, a system in which we do not have to trust anyone. The solution is to use a decentralized network to store this register, instead of storing it in one place, we store it on the computers of many people around the world, each one would have a copy of it. In the centralized network, you just need to shut down the central server, and the network is dead. the decentralized network is much harder to attack. The Information is stored on many nodes, you would have to shut down all of them, which was nearly impossible. Now, the only problem is how do you keep such a decentralized register up-to-date. When I send my coin to Alice, we want the whole network to know that I don't have that coin any more, but  Alice owns it now.  This is where the blockchain comes into play. Why is it called the blockchain, well because the transactions are store in so-called blocks, which form a chain. Now, how is that work? If I send my coin to Alice, my  digital wallet tells the whole network that I want to do this, my wallet signature  proves that I have the right to send this coin to Alice. The transaction then get stored in a list, a block is just that a list of transactions which has a number and a timestamp. If the last block had the number 999, this must be block number 1000. That's why it's called a chain, the blocks are lined up in chronological order, the timestamp shows the moment when I am no longer the owner of this coin, but Alice now is. All transactions that have ever been made in a digital cash system are stored in its blockchain, everyone can look up the whole transaction history, well of course, you don’t see my name and Alice's name in the public register. I wouldn't  want everyone to know how much money I own. What you see in the blockchain are the cryptographic numbers that we have talked about in our last episode. This is my public address, and this is Alice's. They are both long strings of letters and numbers. Fortunately, we don't have to memorize them computers are good at that. Now, you may ask yourself, how do you make sure that everyone agrees which is the correct version of the blockchain? And who has the right to update it. We will answer these questions in our next episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4 What is Mining ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last episode, we talked about the blockchain. A decentralized database that contains all transactions of a digital cash system, but there are some open questions, how can you make sure that everyone agrees which is the correct version of the blockchain, and who has the right to  make entries into that database. The process of verifying blocks and updating the blockchain is called mining. That is a rather funny word for it that you may think of sweaty men working with  pickaxes and shovels, who dig up the earth to find new digital coins. In reality, all you will see in a mining farm are computers busily crunching numbers. The miners are indeed rewarded with the new coins that are produced by the digital cash system, and they deserve to be rewarded, as they make sure that the network functions the way it should. They need to invest a lot of money in computers and electricity so there must be a way to compensate for that. Every miner collects transactions from the network, checks if they follow the rules, and then puts them into a list of transactions, a so-called block. Every miner wants to add his or her new block to the blockchain, and there is only one miner at a time who have the right to do that, this is important  to make sure there is only one valid version of the blockchain on which everyone can agree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a constant race between the miners, and the winner of that race gets an attractive prize,  new digital coins. Miners have to solve a complicated cryptographic  puzzle, it takes a lot of computational power to solve this puzzle, and the more miners compete, the more difficult it becomes to win. It's hard to find the right solution of this puzzle, but it's very easy to check it. So when a miner claims that he has found a solution, all the other miners will double check if it's correct, they will then accept the winner, forget about the block they have worked on and start to work on the next block. It's a never-ending competition. There is a reason why it's so hard to add block to the chain. We want the blockchain to be immutable, no one should be able to go back in time and change its entries. If it was easy to create a new block, the danger of manipulation would be high. But as it requires a lot of works to update the blockchain, you can be sure that no one can tamper with it. Every digital cash system has a blockchain and a process to add new blocks to it. There are hundreds of digital cash systems,  and in nearly  all of them, 100% of the newly produced coins go to the miners. Dash however is \n",
    ", we will show you in our next episode what sets Dash apart from most of the other digital coins.\n",

    "### 5 What Do Masternodes Do ?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is Dash 101, in the last episode we explained the basis of all digital cash systems. Now let's have a close look at Dash, what does Dash do differently from hundreds of other crypto coins. Why do we believe that Dash would be adopted by normal users, not only by geeks. First,  what is similar about Dash and the rest of the filed. Dash also uses cryptography to prove and move ownership. Dash is also based on a blockchain, a public, immutable, decentralized data base and this data base is being updated through a process called mining. But in addition to the network of miners, Dash has a second tie called the master nodes. Master nodes provide a number of functionalities, they make transactions faster and more private, we will explain these features in the next two episodes. Another important function of the master nodes is decision-making, we will talk about this now. you have to understand all digital cash projects are based on an open source software which belongs to no one. This is great as it allows anyone to build new things with it. But sometimes it is necessary to make general decisions , digital cash is supposed to be useful for people and the needs of people change, that's why normal companies do market research and constantly develop new products to always adapt to the needs of customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, Dash is not a company, it is a decentralized autonomous organization, a Dao, a fancy new term that is worth remembering. A Dao has no boss, no CEO, no board of directors, none of these typical features of a company. But how you may ask, in such a fuzzy  form of organization without a hierarchy ever come to any decision. This is another function of the master nodes, they have the right to vote, you can compare them to the voters in a democracy. Each master node has one vote, every month the master node can vote about proposals that anyone can make, if enough master nodes cast a positive vote, the proposal gets accepted. And what is it that master nodes vote on, theoretically anything. For instance, they can vote about how Dash will involve technically in the future, but most of the time, they decide which projects will be funded by the Dao. So, how does this work? This is probably the biggest difference between Dash and most other digital cash systems. Well, Normally, the miners receive 100% of the newly created coins, Dash is a different model. 45% of new coins go to miners, 45% go to the master nodes, which are of equal importance on Dash, and 10% go into the so-called treasury, every month a certain amount of money is reserved to pay for things like software development,  translations, design, marketing, even this video show is funded by the Dao. Because, a majority of the master nodes decided that it's a good idea to do it. This funding mechanism has the big advantage that Dash does not depend on donations or corporate sponsorships. People who do relevant work get paid. Nobody is expected to work for free, and that means stuff gets done. As you see, Dash works a bit like Switzerland, democratic elections , not every four years, but every month. And voting is not just about who is the president  and who makes the laws, it's the master nodes themselves who decide about every step along the way. Just like everyone can become a miner, everyone can run a master node. But unlike mining, you don't need an expensive, specialized computer for that, even cheap computers can do the job of a master node. The biggest hurdle to run a master node, you need to own a certain amount of Dash. You need to have skin in the game, we believe that decisions get wiser if you have something to lose and something to win. In the next two episodes, we have a close look at the other functions of the master nodes, called InstantSend and PrivateSend.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6 What is InstantSend ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last episode, we explained how the Dash Dao comes to decisions and how Dash gets funded. It's the master nodes who make the decisions in the Dash Dao. And for this privilege, they need to do some work, they provide two important functions, called InstantSend and PrivateSend.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at InstantSend first. As we have seen in our episodes about the blockchain and mining, transactions get confirmed by a decentralized network, this process takes some time, sometimes it's minutes, and sometimes hours, depending on several factors, like how many transactions miners have to process and how much you are willing to pay as  a transaction fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, it's ok to wait for some minutes or hours, that's still much faster than a normal bank transfer. but what if you want to buy a coffee at your neighborhood café, you surely don't want to wait for some minutes with a hot latte in your hand until the transaction gets confirmed, your coffee would be cold by then. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So far a payment provider had to take over the risk of the coffer owner, so he would give you the latte, even if the transaction wasn't confirmed yet. But this means another middleman gets in the way and wants his share. The whole idea of digital cash is to cut out the middleman and allow direct payments from person to person without having to trust anyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why Dash has introduced InstantSend, it's a clever software mechanism which makes sure that you will get your money even if the transaction has not been recorded into the blockchain yet. With InstantSend, A transaction will be locked as long as it is not recorded in the blockchain. So it's impossible to spend it another time. It is a bit of extra work for the master nodes to provide this functionality, so an InstantSend transaction has a slightly higher transaction fee than a normal one. But the big advantage, an InstantSend transaction only takes about one second and that's probably worth the higher fee. As a Dash user, you have a choice. You either pay a very low fee if you're ok with a transaction time of a few minutes or you pay a slightly higher fee for an InstantSend if you're in a hurry. Another important feature that Dash provides is privacy, we will talk about Dash PrivateSend in our next episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7 What is PrivateSend ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last episode, we explained how Dash handles InstantSend transaction, now we will have a closer look at the other important functionality that the Dash master nodes provide, privacy. You cannot underestimate the importance of privacy, it's the basis of a free society. We don't want anyone to sneak into our lives, we want to decide ourselves which information we share with whom. And our money is definitely something very private. You may ask yourself isn't  a digital cash system that is based on cryptography private by nature. Unfortunately not. Yes, there are no name stored in the blockchain, just long cryptographic addresses. But everyone can see all transactions as they are publicly stored on the blockchain. If I know someone's public address, because the owner has published it on his blog or has send it to me in an email, I could trace all the transactions that are linked to this address. With a bit of data crunching, you can find out many patterns and make conclusions on someone's income, fortune and spending habits and that's something we definitely want to avoid. There are several ways to provide more privacy in a digital cash system. Dash is using a process called Coin Mixing for that. This means that one can no longer trace back the history of a digital coin to one person as many users swap their digital coin with one another and they end up with the same amount of coins but you cannot follow their tracks anymore. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, you had to trust a coin mixer for this process, Dash uses its network of master nodes which is decentralized. And therefore more secure.  The whole process takes place in the background. All you need to do is select the PrivateSend option in your wallet. As Private Send requires some extra work from master nodes, it costs a slightly higher fee. As a Dash user, you can choose, you can pay a low fee and have less privacy, or pay a higher fee to protect your privacy. Unfortunately, many people don't take their privacy so seriously, they send emails with encryption, and money without Private Send. Our free society is threatened by big data hungry corporations, and ever-growing surveillance state, so privacy becomes more and more important. So please protect yourself by encrypting your emails, using Tor to browse the web and transferring money by Private Send. In the next episode, we will show you how Dash will become even more user-friendly in the future.\n",
