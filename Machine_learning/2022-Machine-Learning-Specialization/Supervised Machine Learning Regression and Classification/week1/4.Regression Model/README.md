# lab1:
In this ungraded lab, you can see how a linear regression model is defined in code, and you can see plots that show how well a model fits some data given choices of w and b.  You can also try different values of w and b to see if it improves the fit to the data.


# lab2
This optional lab will show you how the cost function is implemented in code. And given a small training set and different choices for the parameters youâ€™ll be able to see how the cost varies depending on how well the model fits the data. 

In the optional lab, you'll also get to play with an interactive contour plot.  You can use your mouse cursor to click anywhere on the contour plot, and you see the straight line defined by the values you chose, for parameters w and b.

Finally the optional lab also has a 3d surface plot that you can manually rotate and spin around, using your mouse cursor, to take a better look at what the cost function looks like.
